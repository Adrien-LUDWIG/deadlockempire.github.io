We gladly welcome all contributions. Especially, we <3 pull requests, bug
reports and ideas for features or new challenges. We would also be happy to
hear about your experience with The Deadlock Empire: which parts you enjoyed,
which were too difficult, what confused you, or anything else - shoot us

If you'd like to contribute code, running a local copy of The Deadlock Empire
should be easy:
```
git clone https://github.com/deadlockempire/deadlockempire.github.io
# open deadlockempire.github.io/index.html in a browser
```

Please send any contributions in a pull request against the `devel` branch.
We will try our best to respond as quickly as we can. We would appreciate if
you could test that your contribution works and if you could use a feature
branch.

Since the `master` branch is automatically deployed to
[https://deadlockempire.github.io](https://deadlockempire.github.io),
we update it less frequently than `devel`.

Acknowledgements
===

We stand on the shoulders of giants.

We thank the numerous organizers, sponsors, judges and hackers of
[HackCambridge 2016](https://www.hackcambridge.com/) for the opportunity to
develop this idea and for their support.

We use [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) for manipulating the DOM and for
animations. The design is implemented using vanilla
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). The tutorial challenge uses
[Intro.js](https://usablica.github.io/intro.js/) to familiarize the player
with the controls. Keyboard shortcuts are implemented using [Mousetrap](https://craig.is/killing/mice).

The game uses the [Amatic SC](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/amatic) font
published by [Vernon Adams](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/list/foundry/vernon-adams)
published on [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts).

The logo is a combination of the dragon from
[the Welsh flag](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_Wales_2.svg)
and a lock icon, both from Wikimedia Commons.
